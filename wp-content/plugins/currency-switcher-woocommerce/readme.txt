== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Issues regarding Paypal =

* If you are experiencing some sort of issue regarding paypal, like incorrect currency code displayed in notification emails or anything else, please try to disable the default paypal component bundled with WooCommerce and use [this plugin instead](https://wordpress.org/plugins/paypal-for-woocommerce/)

= How to get the converted price =
If you are trying to display the converted price on a custom template for example you can use our `alg_get_product_price_by_currency()` function.
e.g

`
add_action('woocommerce_single_product_summary', function(){
	if ( ! class_exists( 'Alg_WC_Currency_Switcher' ) ) {
		return;
	}
	global $product;
	$price = get_post_meta( get_the_ID(), '_regular_price', true);
	$converted_price = alg_get_product_price_by_currency( $price, alg_get_current_currency_code(), $product, true );
	$converted_price_formatted = wc_price( $converted_price );
	echo "<h1>{$converted_price}</h1>";
	echo "<h1>{$converted_price_formatted}</h1>";
});
`

= CoinMarketCap not working? =
Please make sure you are using at least one Cryptocurrency on your Currency settings.
You can install [All Currencies for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-all-currencies/) plugin to enable them

= National Bank of Georgia =
If you are trying the National Bank of Georgia server option with no success, make sure that your server has the SoapClient library installed and enabled

= How to override rounding and pretty price per currency? =
If you want for example to turn on the rounding for all products except for Bitcoin, supposing you've set to round and enabled pretty price on plugin's settings:
`
add_filter( 'alg_wc_currency_switcher_correction', function ( $correction, $currency ) {
	if ( $currency == 'BTC' ) {
		$correction['rounding'] = 'no_round';
		$correction['pretty_price'] = 'no';
	}

	return $correction;
}, 10, 2 );
`
