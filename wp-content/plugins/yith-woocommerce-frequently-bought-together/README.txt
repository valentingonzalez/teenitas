The YITH WooCommerce Frequently Bought Together plugin lets you add product suggestions with a simple summary in each product page.

== Description ==
The right cross selling strategy in your shop is crucial because it affects conversion rates in a very significant way.

Explicitly designed to let you make your offers in the most direct way ever, **a well-planned proposal has double advantages for shop owners and customers**. Your suggestions might allow them to save a lot of time and grant you a highly targeted advertising, which is always the most effective one.

**Main features:**

* Specify an unlimited number of suggested products for each single product of your shop
* Customise the title of the section “Frequently Bought Together”
